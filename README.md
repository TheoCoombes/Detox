# Detox
Userscripts that stop social media mobile sites from being so addictive. Built for mobile sites, but should also work on desktop browsers.

## Features

- **Instagram**: Removes ads, reels and the explore page. The page also fades out slowly to avoid excessive scrolling. 
- **YouTube**: Removes YouTube shorts. The page also fades out slowly to avoid excessive scrolling. 
- **Reddit**: The page fades out slowly to avoid excessive scrolling. I use this in conjunction with [this Safari extension](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sink-it-for-reddit/id6449873635) to remove ads and improve the UX on mobile.

## Installation

1. Install a userscript extension for your browser. I am using [Userscripts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) for Safari.
2. Open the raw links to each `*.user.js` file in the repo in your browser.
3. Open the Userscripts extension popup and should see an installation prompt (installation can differ across userscript extensions).
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for all remaining files.
